# github-hello-world
This is my initial sample repo on github.

I cloned the repo to my local machine using the URL that the "clone or download"
button gave me. This was for HTTPS.

Then I added my existing SSH key, which I had created for use with BitBucket.
The clone butten can be switched to give the corresponding SSH command. This
text is used as the target of the git-clone command. There is no "ssh:" or anything
like that.
